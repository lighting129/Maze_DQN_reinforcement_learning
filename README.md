# Maze_DQN_reinforcement_learning

Use Deep Q network to solve maze problem generated randomly

IMPORTANT: comment the env.render() can obtain results quicker (rendering surely much slower than CPU staffssssss).

gym_maze: the gym library for generating experiment environment

How to run? python maze.py

Why it's a mess? I changed the value of a lot of parameters to do experiments.

Any innovation point? See the last part in the report.

the freq=xxx folders? Stored the experiment result.

I think you can find everything you need in my report.

For Q-learning version maze solver, see:https://github.com/saaries/Maze_reinforcement_learning

You should get logs like this if the program works well:
